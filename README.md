# Malware Development
My scripts for my ethical hacking journey.

In this project I upload my attempts at creating succesful malware code as I embark on a journey to do something big.

Most malware scripts here are written in C++ or C since that is the best for working with the Windows API. However if you try to compile these programs using any compiler like `gcc` or `clang`, Windows Firewall will not allow you to. Please ensure you have it disabled or have an exception running.

#### PROGRAM 1

Here there is a script for a reverse shell that can be done by creating a `HANDLE` and Process in Windows API followed by Threads. The shellcode can be obtained from  `msfconsole` or `msfvenom`.

## DISCLAIMER
> Despite it being near impossible to target someone using the scripts in this repo,
> I am not liable for the misuse of the programs to do harm to any machine.

> This repository is mostly for me to track my progress. Please search the first hand sources for a proper guide which I link for every script, on how to learn to write it.

> Many scripts are similar or identical to the code in the source linked. I do not claim these to be mine.
