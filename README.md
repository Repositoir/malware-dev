# Malware Development
My scripts for my ethical hacking journey.

In this project I upload my attempts at creating succesful malware code as I embark
on a journey to do something big.

Most malware scripts here are written in C++ or C since that is the best for working with the Windows API.
However, if you try to compile these programs using any open-source compiler like `gcc` or `clang`on
a Windows Development Configuration such as MinGW,
Windows Firewall will not allow you to. Please ensure you have it disabled or have an
exception running.

Most of the code and tips are from a YouTube content creator named [crow](https://www.youtube.com/@crr0ww), 
whom I highly recommend for actual in-depth learning on malware development and Win32 API in general.

It is recommended to test all code on a Windows virtual machine or a Windows PC
that is disposable. It is noted that many times executing the malicious code results
in unpredictable behavior by Windows including completely resetting to BIOS after a firmware update. 

### PROGRAM 1 - main.cpp

This program uses process injection to hijack a running process on a Windows machine.
Using this, a shellcode that can be procured from `msfvenom` or `msfconsole` on Kali or something
similar is used to inject a reverse shell script. The reverse shell can be listened into by 
running a TCP handler such as that in `msfconsole`.

This code will prompt Windows Security to quarantine and block the executable.
Please take great care in handling the executable.

### PROGRAM 2 - create_process.c

This program is an introductory piece into using the Win32 API from Microsoft. Despite having
32 in the name, this API supports both 32 bit architecture systems and also 64 bit architecture
systems. The code in `create_process.c` simply exhibits the creation of a windows process; which
in this case is to open a standard MS Paint window by accessing `mspaint.exe`. It is done by
the `CreateProcessW()` function.

### PROGRAM 3 - open_process.c

This is an extension of the `create_process.c` and it uses the PID from the `CreateProcessW()`.
to open a process. 

_More content to be added._

### PROGRAM 4 - create_window.c

This program also utilises the Win32 API to create a window on any Windows environment.
This is done by first initializing a `WNDCLASSW` to `0` to all contents within the structure.
After this certain required fields are set including `wc.hbrBackground` which initializes the
background of the window, `wc.hCursor` which set the cursor type on the window and a name
followed by a callback procedure by the `WindowProc()` function. Then a `CreateWindowW()` function
is created with all required values and pointer to the values. Finally, a window loop is created
to retain the window on screen until an input (`WM_DESTROY` in this case) is executed.
